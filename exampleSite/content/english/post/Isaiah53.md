## Isaiah 53

Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

The arm of the Lord refer to some form of power displayed

Why there are some people who are saved but didn't receive healing for their sickness?

The answer is found in v12.

Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,

and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;

2 Chronicles 16:9
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth,

to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.

Who are the strong?

The strong are those who believe the report of the Lord (His Word)

not the doctor's report.
