## Abide in Him to avoid burnt out

When you in this place in communion with God

allowing his word and spirit to be in agreement in you

then how you minister is simply out of he overflow

all you have to do is to **abide in the vine**
and just connected as you intimacy with me.

Then out of is overflow is how you are going to minister

It will avoid burnt out.
