## Abide in Him to avoid burnt out

OUT OF THE OVERFLOW OF RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD

When you in this place in communion with God
allowing his word and spirit to be in agreement in you
then how you minister is simply out of he overflow
all you have to do is to **abide in the vine**
and just connected as you intimacy with me.
Then out of its overflow is how you are going to minister

**It will avoid burnt out**
