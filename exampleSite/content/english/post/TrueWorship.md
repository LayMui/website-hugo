## What is True Worship

John 4 Jesus met the Samarithan woman at the well

Jesus revealed to her what is true worship or

the type of worship God is looking for

It's to worship in Spirit and in Truth

The Spirit man is perfect after receive Christ into the heart.

Worship from the spirit man - the real me and inner core of my being

and to know the Truth of His Word - Jesus

Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.

God is more interested in the heart than outward form.

Worship is Relationship

This passage reveals to me

1. A woman can worship but a stone cannot
2. Jesus reached out to a samarithan woman,

one who was despised and unworthy in the eyes of society and culture

3. This woman has many relationships but none can satisfied her.

Jesus is pointing her to the ultimate relationship - A Relationship with God.
