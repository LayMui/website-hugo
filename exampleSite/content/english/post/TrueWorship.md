## What is True Worship

John 4 Jesus met the Samarithan woman at the well

Jesus revealed to her what is true worship or 

the type of worship God is looking for

It's to worship in Spirit and in Truth

The Spirit man is perfect

Worship from the spirit man - the real me and inner core of my being

and to know the Truth of His Word cos 

God wants us to walk in total freedom

freedom from sins and deception.

Worship is Relationship

This passage reveals to me

1. A woman can worship but a stone cannot
2. Jesus reached out to a samarithan woman, 

one who was despised and unworthy in the eyes of society and culture

3. This woman has many relationships but none can satisfied her.

Jesus is pointing her to the ultimate relationship - A Relationship with God.
