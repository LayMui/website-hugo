## My Sufficiency is in Christ

It's Christ in me, the hope of glory

# 2 Corinthians 3:4-6

And we have such trust through Christ toward God
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything
as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God who
also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant not of the letter
but of the Spirit: for the letter kills but the Spirit gives Life.

Do you see yourself as the dwelling place of God on earth?

You are the Temple of the Holy Spirit

When I am ministering to someone and I am about to lay hands on them.

I do not think Oh God if you don't come down and show up right now. I am sunk.

No What I know is **My sufficiency is not** of myself so the Holy Spirit in me
is going to flow freely becos I recognize the glory of God.

I am acknowledging what is in me Philemons 4-6

I am acknowleging that good thing that is in me so when

I lay hand on the sick, it's not me

It's Christ in me the hope of Glory that is going to flow out of me in a life

flow that is going to bring healing into somebody else's life.

You do not have to battle with this God. You've to show up thing.

Let your motivation be the love of God

Jesus didn't come to help us to manage our sickness but He came to take it away.

If only we would learn to love people first, healing comes as a by-product.

We are not just trying to slap a band aid on people we are bringing people into that relationship

with Jesus in that place of intimacy where they can experience the love of God for themselves

becos you know the Holy Spirit can heal something in 5 sec what 5 yrs of counselling can do.

### Love never fails

Jesus demonstrated the compassion all the time in His earthly ministry

Everytime Jesus moved with compassion you saw a supernatural manifestation of the power of God.

Psalm 91: the bridge to miracle is in the secret place.

In that secret place where you hide under the shadow of the Almighty

In that place of intimacy in your relationship with Jesus that is where

you'll find the power and glory and the miracles.

You don't search for miracles. They are part of our relationship with Him.

As prayer ministers, you're here becos you want to experience God.

You want to see God move, you want to see God touch people through you.

This is the calling that God has for us -

not just healing but to walk in wholeness and health

that's God's plan for every believer.

So many people are broken hearted in this world.

what we see is the physical outward signs of a broken heart.

If all we do as prayer ministers is to slap a band aid and

pray for a headache that's not getting the root of the problem.

but you know love goes ot the heart, love deals with the heart,

it meets people at the heart level.

It heals those wounds so they become whole -
spirit, soul and body and they can go out and be productive healthy

people that not just have got 1 miracle experience

but learn how to walk into divine health - that's the goal.
