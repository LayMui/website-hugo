### The Message to Laodicea

I know thy _works_, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou art

cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,

I will spew thee out of my mouth.

As I listen to the teaching on Fundamentals of Faith by Rick Mcfarland

it said if you operating purely in grace and faith, that's where God wants

your relationship that's being hot towards God

What is cold? That's where everything you are doing is trying to perform for God.
You are trying to live under the commandments.

What the law is going to do? It's going to drive you to your knee.

It's going to condemnn you.

You're going to say. God I need grace. And so the law will do its work

if you are purely going to be under the law.

The problem is when you mix the two.

Just like oil and water do not mix

And you part grace and say 'Lord, I'm going

to try to work for you and everything I can and achieve and then whenever I miss it.

Lord, You make up the rest.

God is not interested in making up your rest.

He is interested in you resting in what He has already made or done.

You need to understand that we need to **operate towards God 100% of the time by Grace Thro Faith**

The Law is based on commands to be achieved

The New Covenant is based upon promises to be believed

I have a hanger with picture and the word 'Do your best, God will do the rest'.

I realise this message comes from false teaching.

God wants of you and me is to rest completely in His finished work on the Cross.

His Grace is His provision for all 
of our needs and we just need faith as a mean to receiving God's grace.
