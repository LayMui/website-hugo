## The Lord's Prayer 

**is prophetic**. 

It is introducing the reality of the Kingdom.

This is a transitional prayer from the old to the new covenant

This prayer has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

Our Father - Jesus revealed a new relationship

Thy kingdom - Jesus revealed a new dispensation

Our daily bread - Jesus revealed a new dependency by faith

2 Cor 9:6-11 He has set into motions a spiritual law 

A principle of sowing and reaping.

To the degree that we give, He's going to provide for us.

Forgive us as we forgive - Jesus revealed that forgiveness is the key

If you don't forgive others, you won't be forgiven - He is talking to Jews under the Law
They are still fulfiling the Law.

We've to be forgiven before we can forgive others 

and now we are forgiven we are equipped to forgive others

Ephesians 4:32 ...even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.

Man's kind of forgiveness is from emotions or from the mind.

But God's kind of forgiveness is to forgive from the heart

Temptation - Jesus revealed the source of 'evil'

James 1:13 In this new covenant, 

God can't be tempted with evil nor He tempts any man

This issue is taken care of. So if a temptation comes your way

it's not from God. It's from the flesh.

James 4:7. We have authority over the flesh and the devil.

Submit yourself therefore to God, Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
