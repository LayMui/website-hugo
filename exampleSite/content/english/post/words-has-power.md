## Our words has power in our natural circumstances

Proverbs 18:21 'Death and Life are in the power of the tongues and those who love it will eat its fruit

The forces of death and life are released by our words

Because as human being we have a tendency more often to speak death than life.
Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.
If you love death, speak it and You'll eat it.
If you love life, speak it and You'll eat it.

Speak: I am wealthy, I am healthy, I am wise. I am good looking.
**Speak it till you believe it**

Matthew 15:11 Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man but what comes out of the mouth
this defiles a man.

Matthew 12:37 For by your words you'll be justified and by your words you'll be condemned.

Alot of sickness comes from a condemned heart
Your heart is saying I deserved to be punished. And then you want to get free from cancer
but your heart is screaming out I am guilty and I deserved to be punished.

And you wonder why you cannot get free from that long term debiliting thing that is attacking
your life.
Why are you punishing yourself for what Jesus was punished for? That's pride.

There is a confession of faith.

This is releasing our faith by our words

There is a confession unto faith.
This is hearing the Word so we come to a place of persuasion

We don't need to confess the Word of God.
He's already persuaded. He also has already provided

Speaking in the wrong direction

Many Christians confess the Word at God with great rapidity and emphasis
This shows they are trying to convince God.

**Speak to your mountains instead**

Faith does not deny the natural but it just doesn't give the natural the last say.

It's important where you put your 'But'

I have a flu in my body but by His stripes I have been healed

I don't have any money in my checking account but God supplies all my need according to his riches in glory
