### John 5:19 Relationship is key to flowing in the gift of the Holy Spirit

I used to attend a small church group when they believe in the baptism of the fire of the
Holy Spirit.

I also noticed leaders or elders show physical movement such as shaking of hands when they minister
in praying for others.

The ministry of the Spirit does not have to be accompanied by our bodily trembling and shaking and jerking.

It's about helping someone else.

You don't even have to feel anything.

It's just a prayer of faith.

If you open yourself up to trembling movement,

you are likely open yourself up to deception.

The Holy Spirit does not need any of these.

It's invisible transaction by faith.

Those 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit described in 1 Cor 12-14.

At spiritual rebirth,  the new believer would have all of these gifts.

Look at Jesus, when Jesus minister, 

He doesn't shake or jerk.

In fact it's those demon possessed that does alot of shaking and jerking.

When someone get into a mystical trance to start to shake and tremble.

They are the poor thing cos they don't know what they are missing.
Becos the Holy Spirit does not need that!

It's not about you.
It's about the other person getting blessed with what you have inside of you.
And that's where the gifts can set people free,
bring healing and deliverance...if we would stop doing the other things.

Words of knowlege to help them know who they are in Christ.
Words of wisdom to help them order their lives rightly.
Discerning of spirits ot help give counsels and know what their heart is.

Did you know that all of us the born again believers are capable of doing
everything Jesus did?

It's all there that potential is in there.
It's just waiting to be released.

The capability is already inside of you 
but you are the one that has to be motivated 
by the **love of God** to step out and touch someone's life with the gifts.

**When the love of God is expressed the gifts are there in that flow of love.**
Rather than waiting to have a sensation or feelings to start minister.
If you dependent on feelings, it takes you out of the realm of the spirit.
But when you are in the spirit, 
it's the love of God that is shed abroad in your heart that is being manifested.
That's how Jesus ministered. It was by **love and in that love, the gifts were working.
So the key to moving in the Spirit is to move in the love of God
And as you move in the love of God gifts will just automatically begin to take place
and there won't be abnormal unusual feelings.
