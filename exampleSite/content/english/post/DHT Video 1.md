We made Christianity consumer based when we think of ourselves than the **kingdom of God**

and end up not fulfilling God's will for our lives.

Why do you call me Lord Lord and not do what I command?

They see God as vending machine
"If I put in enough time I get what I want, I can ask from God
and He will get me things"

Just knowing the precept of the bible does not make you a Christian

It's those Word you live by.
