Jesus said I am the Bread Of Life

This is the official I AM statement
I am the Bread of Life he that comes to me shall never hunger

and he that believes in me shall never thirst

In John 4 with the samaritan woman at the well,

He could have said I am the living water

John 4:10 the moment where Jesus would have said I AM but he didn't

He's the living water, symbolic of his identity, his character, his nature and his purpose.
If you drink of Him you shall never thirst.

God is Spirit

We are created spirit being

The real me is the spirit.

When Jesus uses this symbol to show
I need to let His Spirit fill and and satisfy my spirit man.

Matthew 4:4 man shall not live by (bread) alone but by every word

He is the living Word - the only thing that's going to satisfy mankind

I don't have to be hungry or thirsty anymore or desperate becos I AM lives in me

I am satisfied.

Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled - Matthew 5:10

For he satisfied the longing soul and fill the hungry soul with goodness - Psalm 107:9

O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee, my soul thirst for thee - Psalm 63:1

It's the soul and flesh that need to hungry and thirst
