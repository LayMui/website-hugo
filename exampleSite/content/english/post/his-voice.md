### Spirit witness to spirit

How do I get familiar with His voice?

By start eating and drinking the Word

And you get into the light and out of darkness

You'll start to hear the **Voice of God**

and that's whe life really get exciting and 

you will find yourself in places where you hadn't 

really thought about before. 

And you'll be more satisfied and more fulfilled, 
more joyful, have peace. 

And it may be something you never been dreamed of 

but his voice brought you there.

Because God can see the end from the beginning

John 10:5 Jesus came in by the door legally (thro natural birth)

then He became the door for spiritual birth.

He becomes the door to salvation.
