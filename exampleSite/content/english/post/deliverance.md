Notice in Jesus ministry he constantly deal with demon possessed
But in acts and epistles they don't speak about that subject

It's the work of flesh vs spirit

The whole concept of demons and Christian is not a subject

They didn't mention christian need deliverance

Realise some thing has taken place at the Cross.
The power of the satan is devastated

So in today church
Those deliverance session is more for non believers those not yet recv Christ
If there is deliverance its deception
Most of it is drama because the devil like alot of stage play

Alot of things we think are demons in charismatic church today they aren't

They are just the flesh

They need to apply the Word of God to their lives

You don't find Paul addressing demonisation

Acts 19

Bring out all the Witchcraft articles and burnt them
Nothing is mentioned about casting demons

It's the truth that set pple free.
Demon can't deal with truth

They deal with the law

Under the law, men 's sin increased

Sin gives place

Sin is cooperation with the enemy

If you walk in the truth u will not be influenced or oppressed by them

You don't have to go through weird deliverance session to be made free
