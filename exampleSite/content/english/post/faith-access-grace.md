## Faith access Grace

# Mark 11:23

Grace must be accessed

Faith does not produce things

It accesses the things Grace has provided and produced by God

Faith is a manifestor of Grace

Faith moves mountains - that is not the entire understanding

God uses faith to move things

But in actuality, it's grace moving your mountain using your faith

An analogy: I use a crowbar to move a big boulder

There was a force behind it moving it.

What is the bar? Faith

What is the force that uses faith? Grace

Mark 11:23 For assuredly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain.

Be removed and be cast into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but

believes those things he says will be done. he'll have whatever he says

Zechariah 4:7 says Who are you O great mounntain?

Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain.

You will be removed.

And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of **Grace, grace to it**

So grace is going to be the force that faith uses.

Genuine faith is always based on grace.

If it's not, it's fake faith.

Fake faith is you trying to produce stuff with your faith and is not connected
with what Jesus has already done.

Biblical faith is always toward God.

Grace always comes before Faith
Grace is the initiator.
Grace is God's part
Faith is man's part.
Faith can only receive what Grace has already provided.

Grace has already provided in the unseen realm.

That is where the rub comes. It's that what God is provided is not manifested automatically 
in the natural world. It's in the Spirit. It's in Christ. It's in the born again spirit
In the spiritual realm.
it's there but you cannot detect it with your 5 senses. 
So what have to walk by faith and not by sight
-This is the demarcation from immaturity to maturity.
You are not moved by your 5 senses
You are moved by God's Word and what you see in God's Word.
You are moved by your inward eyes or the eyes of your heart.

Religion faith is when I see, I will believe it
Bible faith is when I **believe** I will see it.

You are called to believe and receive
Your title is **Believer**
Your Job Description is to believe
