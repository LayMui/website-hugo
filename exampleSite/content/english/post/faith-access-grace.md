## Faith accesses Grace
# Mark 11:23

Grace must be accessed

Faith does not produce things

It accesses the things Grace has provided and produced by God

Faith is a manifestor of Grace

Faith moves mountains - that is not the entire understanding

God uses faith to move things

But in actuality, it's grace moving your mountain using your faith

An analogy: I use a crowbar to move a big boulder

There was a force behind it moving it.

What is the bar? Faith
What is the force that uses faith? Grace

Mark 11:23 For assuredly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain. 

Be removed and be cast into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but

believes those things he says will be done. he'll have whatever he says
