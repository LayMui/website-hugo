## James 2:21-25

Jesus never said the Word is like a portrait but it's like a mirror

If you look at the mirror, what do you see?

You see yourself. You're predestined to conform to the image of Christ.

If you look at the Word and you actually doers of the Word, you are being who you are.

The Word is the DNA (Divine Nature Attributes) of God

and it's your DNA.

When you take all these precious promises out and do it,

you work them into your DNA and His DNA become your DNA.

You partake of His divine nature and you're changed.

If you are not doers of the Word, you deceive yourself.
