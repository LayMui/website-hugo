## Private Prayer Life

Matthew 6:5-7
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

Prayer is not for public show or consumption

It's about genuine relationship with the Father God.

God is going to reward us openly for our prayer life.

You can tell who is praying by watching their tendency.. in the things of God

You will see blessing accumulating towards them.

They are being reward openly.

Becos' there's saomething that has been sown in secret.
