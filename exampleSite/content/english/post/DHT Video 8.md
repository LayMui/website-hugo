Jesus commended 2 person of great faith in Matthew 8:5-13 and Matthew 15:22-28

and they have no basis to expect anything so they need great faith to approach God
yet God answer their prayer

The Roman Centurion and the Cannanite woman

Neither of them have a covenant with Him

But I have a covenant relationship with God thro Jesus

God is my Father.

An analogy: It could not take much faith for my children to come and ask me for money cos' we are connected/related

If my children come to me and say 'Dad, I know you got the money but I am not sure if You love me
enough and you let me have it.
If my children talk to me that way, it breaks my heart.
Surely you know Me me by now. If I got it, you'll have it.
The last thing you should question is His willingness.
**All the promise of God is Yes and Amen in Christ 2Cor1:20**

I used to think Jesus is telling me to work towards their faith to have great faith
What I realised from this video 8 teaching
is when I have a relationship with God, faith is not even a question.
I do not need great faith all I need is faith of a mustard seed and God has given each of us
a measure of faith and that faith is Jesus's faith and I have Jesus' faith cos He is in me
and I in Him. That faith is already inherent in that relationship.
