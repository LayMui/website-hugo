## How can there be harmony between 2 verses

Malachi 3:8-9

2 Corinthians 9:7

Malachi 3

8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.

2 Corinthians 9:7

Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

The Answer is in Galatians 3

13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.


Malachi says you'll be cursed if you don't tithe
Paul says in Corinthians - only to give with joy!

Galatians 3:13 says we have been redeemed from 'every' curse.

Malachi 3:8-9 is the OT law

The NT tells us we are not cursed if we don't tithe

Tithe and giving are both biblical principles

The 'Tithe' in the NT is only mentioned twice whereas giving is mentioned often.

Tithing or 10% is a start as you purpose in your heart and not motivated by law.
When law is given, tithing become an obligation

Tithing or giving is not a debt you owe - that profits you NOTHING.

NT giving has no curse attached to it.

Giving motivated by love and thanksgiving.

There ia a 'grace of giving' as mentioned in 2 Cor 8:6-7

It's the attitude of giving that is more important than the giving.

A church that doesn't feed it's people is not worth of giving

It does matter where you plant your seed.
