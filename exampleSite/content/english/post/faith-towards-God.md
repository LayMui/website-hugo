## Faith towards God

Hebrew 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith

Jesus is object of faith.

The bible faith is not rooted in things. It's rooted in JESUS

If you have trouble with faith, you are having trouble with the revelation of Jesus.

Alot of people are trying to look to their faith. Do I have enough faith to get what

I need to do? When you look at faith, faith shrivels under it's own inspection

The time faith becomes robust than ever is when you get a vision of the grace of God

and the vision of the Lord Jesus Christ

Faith just comes out and grabs hold of it and you are not even focusing on faith

that's when your faith is strongest - When you have no focus onn it. The focus is on **Jesus**

You get a revelationn of Him and His grace. Faith is not a problem.

Jesus is the source and object of biblical faith.

There are 3 steps to a victorious Christian life:
1. Look at Jesus
2. Keep looking at Jesus
3. Keep on looking at Jesus.

Romans 8:32 He who did not spare His own Son but delivered Him up for us all

How shall He not with Him freely give you all things.

When you get a revelation of Him then you have a revelation that everything else comes with Him.

Alot of times we are trying to put faith in things but are not putting gaith in the Person of Jesus.

When you put faith in the Healer (Jesus), healing come as a byproduct.
THe people came to Jesus becgiause they has faith in Him as the Healder and they were not exercising the faith 
so much in healing but the Healer.

A faith problem is always a relationship problem.  Selah.
