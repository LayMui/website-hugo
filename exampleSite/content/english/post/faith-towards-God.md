## Faith towards God

Hebrew 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith

Jesus is object of faith.

The bible faith is not rooted in things.
It's rooted in JESUS

If you have trouble with faith, you are having trouble with the revelation of Jesus.

Alot of people are trying to look to their faith. Do I have enough faith to get what
I need to do? When you look at faith, faith shrivels under it's own inspection

The time faith becomes robust than ever is when you get a vision of the grace of God
and the vision of the Lord Jesus Christ

Faith just comes out and grabs hold of it and you are not even focusing on faith
that's when your faith is strongest - When you have no focus on it. The focus is on **Jesus**

You get a revelation of Him and His grace. Faith is not a problem.

Jesus is the source and object of biblical faith.

There are 3 steps to a victorious Christian life:

1. Look at Jesus
2. Keep looking at Jesus
3. Keep on looking at Jesus.

Romans 8:32 He who did not spare His own Son but delivered Him up for us all
How shall He not with Him freely give you all things.

When you get a revelation of Him then you have a revelation that everything else comes with Him.
Alot of times we are trying to put faith in things but are not putting faith in the Person of Jesus.

When you put faith in the Healer (Jesus), healing come as a byproduct.

The people came to Jesus because they has faith in Him as the Healer
and they were not exercising the faith
so much in healing but the Healer.

A faith problem is always a relationship problem. 
You'll always struggle in faith if you do not know or doubt the **love of God towards you**
that's why eCharis teach alot on this - God's love

The New Covenant in a based o na trusting relationship with Jesus.
That's what Christianity is - It's a relationship with Jesus

There are many Christians living under rules and codes and they do not have a relationship
with God and that's why they struggle in their faith.

If you have trouble receiving something you are believing for, go back and spend time
with Jesus and refresh your mind on His character, nature and love for you.

Key message: A faith problem is always a relationship problem.
