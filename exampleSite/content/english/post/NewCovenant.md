## Transitional period from Old into the New Covenant

How do you understand why Jesus said in Matthew 5:30

And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:

for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, 

and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. - Matthew 5:30

How they fit into the **New Covenant** dynamic?

Jesus is transitioning people from Law thinking and Law keeping into

grace and faith thinking.

So it's important to rightly discern and divide the Word of God.

#### Jesus came to fulfil the law so God's next plan can be executed 
### God's next plan is the New Covenant

Jesus is without sin

so he can fulfil the law perfectly

Man cannot keep the law as they have the sin nature

In Matthew 19:25 it said with man its impossible 
but with God all things are possible

The verse in its context is talking about keeping the law

The issues with Israel is they add in tradition of mens to the pure holy law 

and that is why alot of sick pple during Jesus's time

Healing was available under the law the old Covenant

They ate the passover lamb put blood on the door post and none is feeble


Jesus inaugurated the new covenant


### Matthew 26:26-28
King James Version

and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

Jesus came to fulfil the Law and bring about the new covenant which is God's next plan

which we are now in today.

Col 2:14-17  he took away the old

Colossians 2:14
King James Version
14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, 

which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
