This is the go to passage in tribulation times such as this.

Psalms 91:1 Those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

I am one with Him. His Holy Spirit lives in me

God is Spirit He cannot have shadow.
Because He lives in me, so the shadow of the Almighty is my shadow.

If His Word abide in me, the sick get healed by my shadow as I walk pass them

Prayer answered (John 15:7) whatever I ask, it shall be done.

Because I abide in Him and He abide in me.

I will say of the Lord - He is my refuge and my fortress.
my God; in him will I trust

The world will run to the wrong source - taking vaccine and booster jab for protection
and the end result is many suffer the side effects from the jabs
and cause a burden on the health care system.

But I run to the Lord - He is my refuge and protection.
His wisdom far surpass all the earthly ways.
