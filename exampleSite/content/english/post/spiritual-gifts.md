The book of Corinthians is written by Paul to the carnal christians

To the carnal church. he give the most description of gifts of the Holy Spirit
but the church does the opposite 'If I pray/fast long enough, maybe God'll give me a gift'

The more spiritual you are, the less gifts you need. Why?
Becos the more carnal you are, God has to show up with the burst of power/gifts of the Holy Spirit 
to make up what you lack. 

You can be healed by gift (it happen right then) and a gift is given
Gift has nothing to do with spiritual maturity or development

In 1 Cor 13 there is a more excellent way which is love and it's encompass 
fruits of the Holy Spirit described in Galatians 5:22
If I operate in the fullness of the Holy Spirit, all the gifts are there
