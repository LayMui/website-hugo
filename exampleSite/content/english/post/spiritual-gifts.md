The book of Corinthians is written by Paul to the carnal christians

To the carnal church. he give the most description of gifts of the Holy Spirit
but the church does the opposite 'If I pray/fast long enough, maybe God'll give me a gift'

The more spiritual you are, the less gifts you need. Why?
Becos the more carnal you are, God has to show up with the burst of power/gifts of the Holy Spirit
to make up what you lack.

You can be healed by gift (it happen right then) and a gift is given

Gift has nothing to do with spiritual maturity or development

In 1 Cor 13 there is a more excellent way which is love and it's encompass
fruits of the Holy Spirit described in Galatians 5:22
If I operate in the fullness of the Holy Spirit, all the gifts are there

When you have the Giver (Holy Spirit) within you, you do not need to ask God for spiritual gifts
If you know who are in Christ, you let the life of God flow out of you.
From the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks
Your spirit is right perfect, the only way for the spirit to relate to people around you is through your soul
becos the soul has to form the words, the ideas and take things of the spirit
There has to be a connectionn between the Spirit, Soul and Body.
Many people's problems is their mind not renewed and tainted by religion and unbelief
